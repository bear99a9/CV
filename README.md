A Junior Full Stack Developer in Ruby and JavaScript. University of Hertfordshire Physiotherapist graduate, former Extended Scope Spinal Practitioner in the NHS, making the transition into the tech industry. I recently graduated from a four month Makers Bootcamp where I taught myself Ruby & Javascript by building a range of applications and websites through individual and team. As I continue to build on my technical and engineering skills, I want to bring my work ethic and experience to my next role, helping to build outstanding products with clean and well tested code.

## Skills

#### Agile Learner

- I have a strong history of agile learning. During my 11 years with the NHS, I rose from Junior Physiotherapist to Extended Scope Spinal Practitoner. This required me to continuously learn new concepts at pace to ensure that services and patients were well supported. I have great desire to succeed and try new things, which led me to Makers Bootcamp, pushing myself to the edge of my comfort zone and drive on my development.

#### Communication

- I have a proven track record of clear and storng communication. Throughout my working life I regularly gave presentations to both frontline staff and senior management, ensuring that complex ideas were understood fully. I am trained to deliver training in a variety of roles and did so regularly during my employment.

#### Problem Solving

- I excel at problem solving and working through issues in a systematic and holistic way. In a recent process review with an experienced web developer I was given a scenario of talking to a client to gather information of their needs and problem, and provide solution to this issue within a tight 45 mins timeframe.

#### Leadership

- I have spent the past few years working in more senior leadership roles. I feel that my experience of this was shaped by my progression from front line care to senior management.
