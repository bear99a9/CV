I am an ambitious and energetic budding **Full Stack Junior Developer** learning to code at Makers Academy (a 16 week software development bootcamp). I am looking for a role where I can consolidate and extend my programming knowledge.

After graduating from the University of Hertfordshire with a first class degree in Physiotherapy, I spent 11 years working in the NHS finishing as an Extended Scope Practitioner in spinal surgery and chronic pain management. Alongside my NHS work I also played semi-professional national 1 rugby for Bishops Stortford RFC culminating in over 180 appearances for BSRFC and multiple caps for England Counties at international level. I still continue to coach at national 1 level for BSRFC which allows me to continue my passion for people development and coaching.
